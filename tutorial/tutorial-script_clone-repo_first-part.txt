Hi! The purpose of this tutorial is to get people started with development for the NEAR blockchain. 
We are going to learn how to create and deploy a simple smart contract and interact with it using the NEAR Command Line Interface.

NEAR supports writting smart contracts in Rust and AssemblyScript. I think AssemblyScript is a good choice for starting out because it's very similar to TypeScript and JavaScript, which are programming languages that many developers out there are comfortable with.

You are going to need a code editor, a command line tool, node.js and npm installed before starting to follow this tutorial.
//terminal
node -v
npm -v

Check out the NEAR CLI installation link in the description, specially when using Windows, if you don't know how to install them.

For the code editor, I'm going to use VS Code but you can use any editor that you like.

In order to make the video shorter, we are going to clone the base project instead of just typing all the boilerplate code. This way we can get into the fun part quickly. The link for the repository is in the description.
//overlay
https://github.com/adrianosingolani/near-tutorial
//terminal 
git clone https://github.com/adrianosingolani/near-tutorial.git

Let's checkout to the branch video-start, which is the real boilerplate. The main branch has the final code that we will produce here in this tutorial.
//terminal
git branch
git checkout video-start

If you want to know how I created it, all the steps are listed on the README file.

The only dependecy that we are going to need is the NEAR AssemblyScript SDK that is what makes possible to turn our AssemblyScript code into a NEAR smartcontract. Let's install it as a development dependecy:
//terminal
npm install --save-dev near-sdk-as

Now, let's install the NEAR Command Line Interface, that will use to make requests to our smart contract, and a simple AssemblyScript build tool called asbuild:
//terminal
npm install -g near-cli asbuild

With everything installed the last thing that we need is to create a NEAR account on the testnet and login with it. 
Go to https://wallet.testnet.near.org, click on the "Create Account" button and follow the instructions. It's pretty straightforward.
//overlay
https://wallet.testnet.near.org

With account created, log in with near-cli:
//terminal
near login

That's it! We have everything set to start writing our first smart contract and interacting with it.

Let's open the project on the code editor and start writing the smart contract.
//terminal
code .
